## Description
This is a 2D toy gravity simulation written in C++. It allows you to play and experiment with the system of multiple bodies. Though the view is in 2D, the physics is 3-dimensional (the gravitational force is inversely proportional to the distance squared). <br />
The program is written in C++ using the Qt graphics library.<br />
I did this project in order to deepen my knowledge of C++ and algorithms.

## How to run
To run the program, first, you need to download it. Here is the link: https://github.com/VolodymyrRushchak/GravitySimulation/releases/tag/v1.0.0 <br />
Download the gravity.zip archive, unzip it, and run the gravity.exe (only works for Windows 10)<br/>
That's it :)

## How to use
To add a body to the simulation, just press the left mouse button, move the cursor to set a direction for a body, and release. <br/>
You can set the camera focus by clicking on a body.
