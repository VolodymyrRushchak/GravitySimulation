## Description
This is a 2D toy gravity simulation written in C++. It allows you to play and experiment with the system of multiple bodies. Though the view is in 2D, the physics is 3-dimensional (the gravitational force is inversely proportional to the distance squared). <br />
The program is written in C++ using the Qt graphics library.<br />
I did this project in order to deepen my knowledge of C++ and algorithms.
